## Getting Started

### Installation

Prefab can be installed using Composer:

`composer require neighborhoods/prefab`

### Running Prefab
- In your composer file, ensure you have your project name defined. Use the `composer-example.json` file, found in the root of Prefab, as a template
- Create your `Actor.prefab.definition.yml` file as outlined [below](#prefab-definition-file-specification).
- From the root of your project run `./vendor/bin/prefab`
    - This will add all of the supporting files needed to create a working API endpoint

### Prefab Fitness

To see working examples on how you can use Prefab, check out the [Prefab Fitness](https://github.com/neighborhoods/PrefabFitness) repository for examples with fully self-contained environments that you can run locally. 

### Prerequisites

#### PSR-4 Namespace Definition

Prefab assumes users have defined a `psr-4` namespace under the `autoload` key in their `composer.json` file.  Namespaces MUST be defined as `{VENDOR}\{PRODUCT_NAME}`. See the [composer docs](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#psr-4) for more information. Prefab will write generated files under the `fab/` directory in your project root. You should configure your autoloader to first look in `src/`, then in `fab/`. This will allow you to override generated files by placing updated copies of classes in the equivalent `src/` location.

Example:
```
"autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
      "Neighborhoods\\MyPrefabbedProject\\": [
        "src",
        "fab"
      ]
    }
}
```

#### Environment Variables

Prefab expects the following environment variables to be defined.

| Key | Description |
|------|----------|
| SITE_ENVIRONMENT | The environment the application is running in. Should be one of `Local`, `Development`, or `Production` |
| DATABASE_ADAPTER | The database driver to use. See the [Doctrine DBAL docs](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/latest/reference/configuration.html#connecting-using-a-url) for possible values |
| DATABASE_HOST | The database host to use in the PDO connection |
| DATABASE_USERNAME | The database username to use in the PDO connection |
| DATABASE_PASSWORD | The database password to use in the PDO connection |
| DATABASE_NAME | The database name to use in the PDO connection |
| DATABASE_PORT | The database port to use in the PDO connection |

#### Project Structure 

Prefab requires that all Prefab definition files be in a versioned directory under `src/`. For example, `src/V1/Actor.prefab.definition.yml` is valid while `src/Actor.prefab.definition.yml` is not.

#### Materialized Views

Prefab puts an extremely high focus on performance.  One of the ways Prefab achieves fast response times is by ensuring that all HTTP requests result in a single database query on an index, made possible through the use of [materialized views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialized_view). Prefab uses [search criteria](#search-criteria) to interact with its database, which doesn't support table joins.  That means all data for a given request MUST live in the same table. 

Note: Since search criteria allows you to select which data you would like to return, a single materialized view with a superset of all data returned by your HTTP endpoints can be used.

## Prefab Definition File Specification

The purpose of this document is to define the components needed to generate an HTTP endpoint for an actor from a `.prefab.definition.yml` file

The file MUST be named {ACTORNAME}.prefab.definition.yml and saved under `src/`. They should be stored in the same nested directory structure as you would like the machinery to be generated under `fab/`.  
- `table_name`
    - Name of the database table containing the data that populates the actor
- `supporting_actor_group`
    - The collection of supporting actors you need generated for the actor
    - Can be one of `complete`, `collection`, `minimal` or `handler`
    - This field is optional and defaults to `complete`
    - See [below](#supporting-actor-groups) for more information
- `http_route`
    - The HTTP route to access the actor
    - This field is optional and unnecessary if you don't want to expose the actor to HTTP traffic
- `http_verbs`
    - HTTP methods allowed for an actor. Can include `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`.
    - Note: Since mutative and destructive actions are not yet patterned for repositories, you will need to override the generated handler to call the proper repository method.
- `constants`
    - Additional user-defined constants to add to the actor interface.
    - This field is optional
- `identity_field`
    - Name of the database column that uniquely identifies a record for the actor
- `properties`
    - The class properties of the actor. Each property should have:
        - `data_type`
            - The type of object the property represents. This can be a primitive or a fully qualified namespaced object
            - Note: This used to be called `php_type` which is maintained for backwards compatibility
        - `record_key`
            - Name of the key containing the data that populates the class property
            - Note: This used to be called `database_column_name` which is still maintained for backwards compatibility 
        - `nullable`
            - Whether or not this property can be null. If true, the builder method will surround this property with isset() before attempting to set the value on the actor
            - If not set, defaults to false
        - `created_on_insert`
            - This denotes properties that are not expected to be present before inserting the record into the database.
            - If true, the buildForInsert() method will surround this property with isset() before attempting to set the value on the actor. However, the build() method will still require this property when building a record from the database.
            - If not set, defaults to false

```
## Search Criteria

Search Criteria is a data mining query language (DMQL) utilized by Prefab applications to provide a flexible API that enables HTTP clients to define how they want to ask for data rather than services explicitly implementing each use case. Search Criteria consists of filters along with optional sort order and pagination instructions.

### Filters

Search Criteria filters are used to define the `WHERE` clause of a database query. Filters should be included as an array under the searchCriteria[filters] key. Each filter consists of the following:

Query Parameter Key: `searchCriteria[filters]`

| Key | Data Type | Description |
|-----|---------|------|
| `field` | string | The database column the filter applies to |
| `condition` | string | The condition to query by. See below for a full list of conditions |
| `values` | array | The values to include in a query. If a condition is used that only applies to a single value (eg. `=`) any values after the first will be ignored |
| `glue` | string | The condition to use when grouping filters together. Can be either `and` or `or` |

#### Conditions

| Key | Condition | Description |
|------|----|----------|
| `eq` | `=` | Will match values that `= values[0]` |
| `neq` | `<>` | Will match values that `!= values[0]` |
| `in` | `IN` | Will match values that are in `values` |
| `nin` | `NOT IN` | Will match values that are not in `values` |
| `lt` | `<` | Will match values that are less than `values[0]` |
| `lte` | `<=` | Will match values that are less than or equal to `values[0]` |
| `gt` | `>` | Will match values that are greater than `values[0]` |
| `gte` | `>=` | Will match values that are greater than or equal to `values[0]` |
| `like` | `LIKE` | Will match values that are like `values[0]` |
| `nlike` | `NOT LIKE` | Will match values that are not like `values[0]` |
| `is_null` | `IS NULL` | Will match values where `field` is null |
| `is_not_null` | `IS NOT NULL` | Will match values where `field` is not null |
| `st_contains` | `ST_Contains(field, st_geomfromtext(value))` | Will match values where `field` contains `values[0]` |
| `st_dwithin` | `ST_DWithin(field, center, radius)` | Will match values where `field` is within point `values['center']` with a radius of `values['radius']` |
| `st_within` | `ST_Within(field, st_buffer(st_geomfromtext(center), radius))` | Will match values where `field` is within point `values['center']` with a radius of `values['radius']` |
| `contains` | `field @> ARRAY[values]` | Will match values where json `field` contains all `values` |
| `overlaps` | `field && ARRAY[values]` | Will match values where json `field` contains any `values` |
| `jsonb_key_exist` | `jsonb_exists(field, value)` | Will match where `values[0]` exists as a jsonb key in `field`|

### Sort Order

A sort order is used to define the order in which data should be returned. It consists of an array with field and a direction.

Query Parameter Key: `searchCriteria[sortOrder]`

| Key | Description | 
|-----|------|
| `field` | Database column the sort applies to |
| `direction` | The order to be applied to the sort. Can be either `asc` or `desc` |

### Pagination

A page size can be defined in order to limit the number of results returned by a query. Set a page size by providing an integer under the key `searchCriteria[pageSize]`. You can retrieve additional pages of data by supplying a current page. Set the current page by providing an integer under the key `searchCriteria[currentPage]`.

## Supporting Actor Groups

Prefab supports generating different subsets of supporting actors to support various use cases. For information on how to specify a supporting actor group, see the [Prefab definition file specification](#prefab-definition-file-specification). The following supporting actor groups are available:
- `complete` - Generates all supporting actors.  This should be used when you need to be able to build an actor from storage and return it via HTTP.
    - Included supporting actors
        - Factory
        - Builder
        - Aware Traits
        - Repository
        - Map
        - Map Builder
        - Handler
- `collection` - Generates supporting actors for building and handling groups of typed objects. This is often used to represent a collection of actors in a JSON database column. 
    - Included supporting actors
        - Factory
        - Builder
        - Aware Traits
        - Map
        - Map Builder
- `minimal` - Generates the minimum number of supporting actors to build an actor. This can be used to represent a single, typed object.
    - Included supporting actors
        - Factory
        - Builder
        - Aware Traits
- `handler` - Generates only Handler instance. This can be used in addition to Buphalo generated Actors to provide HTTP functionality.
    See [Repository Handler docs](docs/RepositoryHandlerOnly.md)
    - Included supporting actors
        - Handler
        
## Subset Container Buildable Directories

As Symfony containers get bigger, the response times for HTTP requests increase.  To prevent slow response times, Prefab supports user-defined subset container building. Prefab users can define what should be included in the Symfony container for each route, so only the necessary actors are initialized.  This buildable directory file is optional and Prefab will build the entirety of `src/` and `fab/` by default if the file is not found. If the file is present, then all routes MUST have a corresponding key with directories to be built.

- Note: On the first request, Prefab will write this file to disk as a PHP array in the directory `data/cache/Opcache/HTTPBuildableDirectoryMap`. When making changes to the Buildable Directory File, the cached file MUST be deleted in order for changes to be reflected in the code.  It is also highly recommended to ensure [Opcache](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.opcache.php) is enabled in production to prevent a read from disk on every HTTP request. 

The top level key in the buildable directories file for each group should be the first two parts of the URI for the paths that use that container. If a key with the first two parts of the URI is not found, Prefab will then check for a key with just the first part of the URI.
- Examples
    - `neighborhoods.com/mv1/property/{searchCriteria}` would build all directories under the `mv1/property` key in the example file below
    - `neighborhoods.com/mv2/property/{searchCriteria}` would build all directories under the `mv2` key in the example file below

`buildable_directories` - Represents the directories of HTTP actors you would like to include for a given request. Each buildable directory will include the corresponding path under both `src/` and `fab/`. Since the `buildable_directories` represents paths, **forward slashes** (/) should be used as a separator.
- Example: 
    - A buildable directory of `MV1/property` will include `fab/MV1/property` (if it exists) and `src/MV1/property` (if it exists) in the container.

`welcome_baskets` - These are the namespaces of the HTTP machinery that Prefab generates that should be included in a request. Since `welcome_baskets` represent namespaces, **backslashes** (\\) should be used as a separator.
- Example: 
    - `Doctrine\DBAL` will include all files under the `Doctrine\DBAL` namespace that are in `fab/Prefab5/Doctrine/DBAL`.

`appended_paths` - These are any additional paths that you want included in your container that are not under `fab/` or `src/`. Paths are relative to the root of your project.  Since `appended_path` represents paths, **forward slashes** (/) should be used as a separator.

**Example**
```yaml
# Place this file at the root of your application.
mv1/property: # The URI to the component Handler.
  buildable_directories:
    - MV1/Property # The relative path to the directory of the component.
  welcome_baskets:
    - Doctrine\DBAL
    - PDO
    - Opcache
    - NewRelic
    - Zend\Expressive
    - SearchCriteria
  appended_paths:
    - some/other/dir
mv2: # The URI to the component Handler.
  buildable_directories:
    - MV2 # The relative path to the directory of the component.
  welcome_baskets:
    - Doctrine\DBAL
    - PDO
    - Opcache
    - NewRelic
    - Zend\Expressive
    - SearchCriteria
  appended_paths:
    - some/other/dir

```

By default, Symfony containers are built on the first HTTP request. Since this can add a significant amount of time to the first request, it is recommended that you prebuild your containers before serving production traffic. This can be accomplished by adding the following script to your `bin/` directory and including it as a `post-update-cmd` and/or `post-install-cmd` script in your `composer.json` file after `vendor/bin/prefab`.

``` php
#!/usr/bin/env php
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);
error_reporting(E_ALL);

require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';
use ReplaceThisWithYourVendorName\ReplaceThisWithTheNameOfYourProduct\Prefab5\HTTPBuildableDirectoryMap\ContainerBuilder;

$primer = new ContainerBuilder\Primer();
$primer->primeContainers();

return;

```

## Semantic Versioning

Since Prefab is a code generation tool that allows users to override specific files and behaviors as needed, Prefab can't make a guarantee a minor version upgrade will work with your overriden files. Prefab *does* guarantee that all minor version upgrades of a purely Prefabbed project (no overriden files) will not have any breaking changes.  If you *do* override any files, it's important that you test your project to verify those files still work as expected with the new version of Prefab.

## Debug Mode
Debug mode can be enabled by setting the environment variable `DEBUG_MODE=true`. Enabling debug mode will output additional details about exceptions and errors thrown during HTTP requests.  Note that this requires a valid container to be built in order to be used. If there is an error during container building (eg. A missing Symfony service file), you will not have the additional visibility provided by debug mode.
